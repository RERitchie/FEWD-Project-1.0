# FEWD-Project-1.0
This is the initial release of my FEWD project. The website is intended to be a brief overview of four popular Arduino microprocessor boards, along with a simple programming example and links to websites for more information. The Applications page will eventually showcase projects and code I've written for Arduino. The project is online at www.pmgrimsley.com

The main carousel is implemented in the Bootstrap framework.
